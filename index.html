                    <p>Outside of Jamaica, N.Y.’s, Long Island Railroad station, thousands of daily commuters wait on the crowded intersection of Sutphin Boulevard and Archer Avenue for the next bus available to take them back to their homes after a long day of work.</p>
                    <p>While people jam into the crowded Q6 line at 5 p.m. on a Monday, other frustrated patrons are left behind searching for taxis or other transportation options. Sometimes, settling for choices that aren’t legal.</p>
                    <p>“You have other communities that have quality bus service, and what do you have in our community? We have vans. We still have the legal and illegal vans,” said Yvonne Reddick, District Manager of Queens Community Board 12.</p>
                    <p>The vans that Reddick references appear daily on Jamaica Center and Archer Avenue/Parsons Boulevard, a section that accounts for the highest bus ridership volume and intensity in all five boroughs, <a href="http://web.mta.info/nyct/facts/ridership/ridership_bus_annual.htm">according to the MTA</a>.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>Though most vans and drivers are licensed by the Department of Transportation and the Taxi & Limousine Commission, there is a growing presence of illegal van drivers not willing to adhere to regulations or pay expensive licensing fees.</p>
                        <p>The illegal vans then put pressure on an overburdened and overcrowded MTA bus system, potentially stealing riders from popular lines like the Q44 that runs north and south from Flushing. That route has seen its ridership numbers decrease from 9.3 million to 8.6 million from 2013-18, <a href="http://web.mta.info/nyct/facts/ridership/ridership_busMTA_annual.htm">according to the MTA's Annual Bus Ridership Chart</a>.</p>
                        <p>“When they’re boarding those vans, they don’t know whether the driver is insured or if they have proper licenses,” said Reddick.</p>
                        <p>It’s no wonder commuters are risking their safety, as Queens Community District 12 riders through Jamaica and St. Albans have to deal with an exhausting average commute time that is 49 minutes one-way—<a href="https://communityprofiles.planning.nyc.gov/queens/12">the second-highest</a> throughout all the five boroughs, per NYC.gov’s census data.</p>
                        <p>“At the end of the day, people just want to get home. I don’t even think they are thinking about safety,” said Reddick.</p>
                        <p>Unfortunately, the MTA may have trouble steering commuters away from illegal van services.</p>

                            <p>The organization’s proposed plan, the <a href="https://new.mta.info/bronxbusredesign/about">Bus Redesign Program</a>, which aims to improve the reliability, convenience and speed of buses, is not expected to be released until the spring of 2020.</p>
                            <p>Executing the plan could take years depending on the level of infrastructure repair, which may result in more commuter residents ditching the MTA to continue to settle for other shady services.</p>
                            <p>“We don’t have sufficient buses; we don’t have enough buses,” said Reddick. “There’s no reason somebody during peak hours has to wait an hour or 45 minutes and all for a bus.”</p>
                            <p>To make matters worse, Queens MTA buses have crawled to a record slow 8.9 mph average speed in August 2019 along with slower buses overall throughout New York's five boroughs, per the <a href="https://new.mta.info/bronxbusredesign/about">MTA’s Bus Performance Dashboard</a>.</p>

                                Combine slower buses with one-way fares at $2.75, Jamaica, known as the biggest transportation hub in all five boroughs, is more vulnerable to being overrun by illegal van operations.
                            </p>
                            <p>Queens Council Member I. Daneek Miller (D-St. Albans), a committee member of New York’s City Council Transportation Board, has attempted to slap strict regulations on illegal van services after proposing <a href="https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=3498505&GUID=70DB1544-80FD-4AA6-8593-1C56C7E7607F&Options=&Search=">Local Law Initiative 897-A</a> at the beginning of 2019.</p>
                            <p>The legislation aims to hold the van industry accountable by issuing heavy fines up to $500 to drivers operating unlicensed vehicles.</p>
                            <p>But whether the bill can deter drivers from picking up passengers illegally, remains questionable.</p>
                            <p>“After the bill was introduced to try to curtail some of the illegal vans—the van operations—it seemed like they got worse,” said Michele Keller, a chairperson for Queens Community District 12’s Transportation Committee.</p>
                            <p>“You have to be in control of it before it gets out of hand.”</p>
